/*

    Private data fields for storing:
        hours in 24-hour format (e.g. 17 is 5:00 PM).
        minutes
        seconds

        When referencing the fields in your methods, make sure to prefix the usages with `this.`

    A default constructor that sets the time to midnight.
    A constructor that takes hours, minutes and seconds as input.

    A function called “increment” that takes a number of seconds as a parameter, and increases the time by that
    many seconds (you may have to increase the hour and minute as well).

    A function called “print” that takes one parameter, a bool called “military”.
    If military is true, you should print the time in 24-hour format, otherwise print in the 12-hour AM/PM format.

    Write a static function inside the Time class that takes a String in the form "HH:MM:SS" (in 24 hour time)
    and returns a Time object.
        Hint: you'll want to use `String.split(":")`
        Hint: you'll probably also want to use `Integer.parseInt`


The goal output is given below:

1:00:00
1:00:00 AM
19:00:30
7:00:30 PM
14:16:01
2:16:01 PM
